Progress
After speaking with Jim after the meeting on Tuesday, I think we have three separate applications to develop, configure, or purchase. In priority order, they are 

1) race status monitors.
    * current racer information page
    * tournament bracket progression
    * race metric collection and display (arduino data)
    * race schedule information
    * must be functional in the absence of a reliable internet connection. (3 rPis? One triple-head workstation?)

2) event website
    * racer registration
    * racer gallery
    * crowd voting
    * replication of displays from app 1 if connectivity allows

3) store for merchandise sales.
    * stretch goal. unlikely to happen by July 26.
    * potentially buy this instead of building. explore squarespace and similar online stores. explore amazon fulfillment.



Issues
* Internet connectivity during Makerfaires.
